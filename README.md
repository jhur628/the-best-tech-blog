When the user clicks the sign in link on the nav bar, the user is taken to the sign in page. The user may sign in, which will take the user to the dashboard page. The user may also sign up with the link at the bottom of the sign in page. Once the user has signed up, the user will be taken to the dashboard.

When the user is at the dashboard page, the user may make a new post, edit/delete a post, or edit/delete a comment.
